After creating the simple game I added two fairly basic extensions. The first
extension was adding sound. I added sound when the alien shoots and when the
ship shoots. Next, I added a points system. When you kill the closest types of
aliens you receive 5 points, the second furthest you receive 10 points, and
the next is 15 points. With this, I display what the players score is at the
end of the game. Moreover, I display the lives and the score at all times during
the game.
